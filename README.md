## Description üìù

During this course I created a frontend app with React. The data I use comes from the NMVW Collection API. The user has the ability to play a game where they have to guess from which time the object comes from. The item page shows an object with a title and picture along with a timeline aswell, where they can place a marker. The closer the user is to the correct time, the more points they get.

## Features üõ†Ô∏è

### API request

The app starts with an API request to the NMVW collection API. It searches for 3 things using a endpoint and a SparQL query.
```
data: {
  title: string
  date: string
  imgUrl: string
 }
```

### Timeline features

- [x] Searches for a random collection.
- [x] Able to select a timestamp.
- [x] Earn points if your close to the correct answer.


### Known Bugs

- If the year is close to 2000 it automatically sets the offset to 2019.

### Upcoming features

- [ ] Able to search a specific country's collection.
